      <p>
        My name is <strong>Pavlína Říhová</strong> and <strong>Tea Therapy</strong> is an expression of both my personal and professional path.
        It is a meeting of calm, care and deep listening. Just as in the Japanese tea way,
        my work is guided by respect, attention to detail and devotion to each moment.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        <strong>心構え (kokorogamae)</strong> – doing things with one’s whole heart. This is how I approach therapy.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My path toward mental health work grew from a deep interest in the human being – in their vulnerability,
        strength and quiet inner transformations. At <strong>Charles University</strong> I had the privilege of studying
        under exceptional figures such as <strong>Prof. Marie Vágnerová</strong> and <strong>Prof. Helena Haškovcová</strong>.
        Through them I found my way not only to developmental psychology, but also to medical ethics and palliative care.
        From this stems my emphasis on wholeness, dignity and authenticity for every client.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Over the years I have worked, for example, in an organization supporting blind children, assisted in children’s
        art-therapy groups, and collaborated with the Czech Association for Mental Health on the project
        <strong>Paths Out of the Labyrinth of Mental Illness</strong>. The project supported people with mental health difficulties
        while also working to destigmatize mental illness in society. It also contributed to important legislative changes,
        including the abolition of cage beds in institutional psychiatric care.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy dancing, growing bonsai trees, playing chess, and getting lost in books.

        <em>
          I had the honor of meeting Ben Furman, M.D., a renowned Finnish psychiatrist and psychotherapist whose books
          have been published in many languages worldwide. In Czech, I especially recommend
          “It’s Never Too Late for a Happy Childhood,” and for children, “Toni’s Bad Dream… and How Grandma Helped Him,”
          both published by Portál.

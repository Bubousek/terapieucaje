      <p>
        Therapy, for me, is not a path of “fixing” – it is a return. Just as the tea ceremony is not about the tea itself,
        but about meeting. About stillness. About respect for the present moment.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In my therapeutic practice I focus primarily on <strong>children, adolescents, and women</strong> – groups
        that often carry the greatest vulnerability.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I work <strong>eclectically</strong>, according to the unique needs of each person, drawing on effective tools
        from various psychotherapeutic approaches (biosynthesis, SFT, DBT, and others), including
        <strong>non-verbal methods</strong> such as art therapy, play therapy, and sandtray work.
        I also integrate current insights from neurobiology into my practice.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I believe that a conversation held in an atmosphere of trust, calm, and natural presence can open a path
        toward inner balance and personal growth. For this reason, I work exclusively <strong>in person</strong>,
        with trust in the power of genuine human connection.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        A cup of warm tea here is not just an addition – it is a symbol of slowing down, quieting the mind, and care.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Who I Work With</h3>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Children</strong> who need understanding and a sense of safety in a changing world.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Adolescents</strong> who are searching for themselves and their place, and who need to be accepted as they are.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Women</strong> who long for a space of their own – for calm, clarity, or change.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Sessions take place in the calm and safe environment of my <strong>Therapy Studio</strong> (see photos),
        over a cup of <strong>organic tea</strong> of your choice (including fruit and herbal teas for children),
        through sensitive and supportive conversation or non-verbal techniques, always aligned with your needs,
        goals, and individual pace.

        If you are looking for a space where you can breathe at your own pace and where even what cannot be spoken
        will be listened to — <strong>perhaps this is where we meet</strong>.
